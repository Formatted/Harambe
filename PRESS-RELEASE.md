## SWICK - The Ultimate Homepage and Webportal ##

  Swick is an app that can help you get to the content you need on the internet much faster, it's a workflow optimizer.

## Summary ##
  Swick is an app that can help you get to the content you need on the internet much faster. Or as we like to say, swick is the ultimate homepage and web portal.

  Set up your own buttons to open several tabs with a single click. Configure interest feeds to get the latest info aggregated and streamed to your home page.

  Also, get a friendly greeting dependant on time of day, and your location. This also allows for an overview of your local weather, as well as time of sunset/sunrise depending on current time of day.

  The SentiBar close to the bottom of the page uses machine learning to analyze the content of financial and global news over the last hour and displays it in a dynamic infographic.

## Problem ##
  When you start any workflow at your computer, you usually have to open a bunch of websites, or specific locations, and this can be time consuming, as well as lead to big mess of bookmarks. We aim to streamline this process, and more!

## Solution ##
  Set up your own buttons to open whatever tabs you need for a given workflow with a single click. Then configure interest feeds to get the latest info aggregated and streamed to your home page, always present, but not in a distracting way to keep you up to date.

## How to Get Started ##
  To configure a new button or edit an existing one, open the settings panel and input a name. Then, enter all the URLs that you want to open as new tabs when the button is clicked, and save the button. To delete an existing button, just enter the name of the button and hit delete.

  To configure which interest feeds are streamed at the top of your homepage, just select the 'configure feeds' tab, and select any two that you want displayed. 'Clear' is an option for a nice and quiet environment. The current selection displays the current feeds of course.
